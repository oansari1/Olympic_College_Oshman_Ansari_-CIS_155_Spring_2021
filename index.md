## Welcome to my repository!

I'm still learning how to configure github pages, and so far this is the only way I've been able to get it to work.
These are the links to the individual pages of my HTML project. They link to one another, so clicking on any of them should allow you to navigate to all the others.
I'm providing all of them in this markdown file so that you can jump straight to the one you want to see.
