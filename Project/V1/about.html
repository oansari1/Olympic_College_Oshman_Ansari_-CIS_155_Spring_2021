        <h3>Now for the actual "About" stuff:</h3>
            <p id="about">My name is Ozzie, and I've worked as welder/fabricator in Virginia and Washington for 7 years. Before that, I worked in the auto parts industry
            for an additional 7 years, which is what made me want to learn to weld and fabricate - I wanted to be able to modify and customize cars.
            <br />
            I learned to weld and earned my certifications from the <a href="https://www.rvaschools.net/RATC" style="color: red">Richmond Adult Technical Center</a>, 
            where I learned to stick, MIG and TIG weld. My career has been focused around TIG welding, primarily with aluminum but also stainless and carbon steels.</p>
            <aside>I was raised in Virginia, a beautiful state! If you're interested in visiting sometime, check out <a href="http://www.virginia.org">The Official Tourism Website of the Commonwealth of Virginia</a>

            <p>The products I am selling on this site are things I've decided to build for myself, and being pleased with the results, decided to sell to everyone else! 
            I also am willing to custom fabricate and weld other projects for clients, please contact me with your ideas for pricing and scheduling.</p>
