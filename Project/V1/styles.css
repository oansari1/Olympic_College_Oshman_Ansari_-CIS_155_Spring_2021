    CSS155 Project V1
    filename: styles.css


This stylesheet has been created to change the appearance of the pages found on my project website.

The rendered pages don't look great, but this is version 1.0 after all. Focus was put on incorporating elements and styles rather than content and aesthetics.
More content will be coming. Hopefully it'll look pretty by the time V4 rolls out. Layout will change dramatically once I understand how to utilize it fully.


Learning outcomes featured in this stylesheet: 

M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS 
    Precedence: Changing the font colors for certain elements (i.e. hyperlink for RATC website is red) demonstrates precedence, as the last defined value within the element has precedence
    Inheritance: The text color applied to the body element is present in all elements contained within, unless otherwise specifified. This demonstrates inheritance

M2LO4 Demonstrate external, embedded, and inline styles
    Embedded: The background color was embedded in the HTML of the pages instead of using a stylesheet to apply it
    Inline: The link color for the RATC website on about.html was set using an inline style

M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors
    There is a contextual selector for the nav bar links, specifying that only the nav links will not be underlined
    The ordered list text color has been changed using contextual selectors

M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector
    ID: Section ID "about" was used to adjust font size of a particular section
    Class: OL class "fluff" was used to change text color

M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id
    Used "href contains" to select a hyperlink attribute based on a word it contained

M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-classes and a pseudo-element selector
    Pseudo-class: Selected even and odd OL elements to modify separately
    Pseudo-element: Selected first letter of paragraph elements to enlarge

M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements
    CSS was used to remove markers from list items

M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements
    Fonts, text size and text colors have been set using CSS

M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS
    Utilized RGB and HSL values to describe font colors. If viewed on older browsers, color should be the same
    
M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS
    Both page background and font colors were set using CSS instead of HTML
